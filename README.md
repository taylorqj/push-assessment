# Push Assessment

#### Push Assessment has been helping interviewees get full-stack positions since 2015.

Our team, consisting of one, has worked very hard to release the first stable build of Push Assessment. We've spent a total of three hours grabbing sculpin's from the fridge, collaborating, and pushing well-deserved and eloquent code. Our goal is to provide interviewers with jolly good laughter and a sudden urge to send offer letters.


### 1.0.0
* We decided on Angular.js over React.js -- we're still not 100% comfortable with HTML + JavaScript sleeping in the same bed.
* We did not use Gulp or Browserify due to how optimized our application already is! We've successfully created our **entire** application in four JavaScript files of 40 lines or less.
* Node and Express is serving you the client side.
* We found the nature of consuming two API routes great! Although we didn't initially see the trick of many users coming back rather than a single user -- using `$q` to solve our problems of `$http` iteration on user's and their tasks -- we got through it.
* Many interviewers stated we should write the solution on JSFiddle, Codepen, or HTML and keep it simple. Here at Push Assessment we strive to keep things simple, but we also think it's important to be a little different. Be yourself and show customers you care.
* This application also comes in an all new flavor called React.js! Just ask and we'll provide beta access.

## Thanks for your time Push! ;)
